ConverTube can download and convert up to 5 videos at the same time. Made with the PyQT GUI toolkit with multithreading to allow for simultaneous downloading and converting. Must have Python 3 installed to your device.


# Attention
***Downloading multiple videos at the same time may slow down your internet connection.***
***Also, converting up to 5 videos at once may cause your computer to slow down. This app is written in Python which naturally has a slow runtime speed. So conversion time won't be the fastest.***
***You will need ffmpeg installed to your device.***
