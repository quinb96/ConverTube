ConverTube can download and convert up to 5 videos at the same time. Made with the PyQT GUI toolkit with multithreading to allow for simultaneous downloading and converting. Must have Python 3 installed to your device.
To install the dependencies, open your terminal and cd to the root of the project directory. If you're on Linux, type ``sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt``. If you're on Windows, type ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

*Releasing a setup.py script later.*

# Attention
***Downloading multiple videos at the same time may slow down your internet connection.***
***Also, converting up to 5 videos at once may cause your computer to slow down. This app is written in Python which naturally has a slow runtime speed. So conversion time won't be the fastest.***
***You will need ffmpeg installed to your device.***
